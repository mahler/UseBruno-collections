## OpenWeather Collection
This collection calls [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api).
They are designed to work with the free plan.

# APPID
OpenWeather uses an APPID as an accesstoken. I use this with [1Password integration](https://netfactory.dk/posts/2023/usebrunno-with-1password/).

Export the APPID as OPENWEATHER_APPID="op://vault/record/location" or export the value directly and start Bruno.
